    I'm a Computer Science and Applied Math double major at Yale University and an undergraduate researcher. I'm obsessed with all things research, hoping to explore the frontiers of robotics and AI. My research focuses are in developing learning and planning algorithms to enable robotic systems to work in complex, human-centric real-world environments.

    I also love playing the piano, hiking mountains, and I'm starting to get my feet wet in Unity game development. Check out my publications tab for more details about the projects I worked on or feel free to contact me at
