<div style="text-align: justify"> I'm a Computer Science and Applied Math double major at Yale University and an undergraduate researcher. I'm obsessed with all things research, hoping to explore the frontiers of robotics and AI. My research focuses are in developing learning and planning algorithms to enable robotic systems to work in complex, human-centric real-world environments. </div>

<div style="text-align: justify"> I have conducted research under the guidance of [Brian Scassellati](https://scazlab.yale.edu/people/brian-scassellati) at the Yale Social Robotics Lab, [Marynel VÃ¡zquez](https://marynel.net/) at the Interactive Machines Group, [Dragomir Radev](http://www.cs.yale.edu/homes/radev/) at the Language Information and Learning lab at Yale (LILY), [Nilanjan Chakraborty](https://www.cs.stonybrook.edu/people/faculty/NilanjanChakraborty) at the Interacting Robotic Systems Lab at Stony Brook University, and more recently [Juho Kim](https://juhokim.com/) at the KAIST Interaction Lab (KIXLAB). </div>

<div style="text-align: justify"> I also love playing the piano, hiking mountains, and I'm starting to get my feet wet in Unity game development. Check out my publications tab for more details about the projects I worked on or feel free to contact me at michal.lewkowicz@yale.edu! </div>

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
